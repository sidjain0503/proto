# Proto - AI SaaS Template for JS Devs

Proto Frontend: Next js and Backend: Node.js, Express, MySQL-based application designed with a focus on modularity, maintainability, and security. 

Any modern ai application needs good design, fast development and flexibility to scale when needed. Proto is a work in progress from my end to cater these exact needs.
